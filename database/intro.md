## 基本概念
1. Database

  > Database - A container (usually a file or set of files) to store organized data.

2. Table

  > A structured list of data of a specific type.
 
3. Schema

  > Information about database and table layout and properties.

4. Column

  > A single field in a table. All tables are made up of one or more columns.

5. Datatype

  >  A type of allowed data. Every table column has an associated datatype that restricts (or allows) specific data in that column.

6. Row

  > A record in a table.

7. Primary key

  >  A column (or set of columns) whose values uniquely identify every row in a table.

8. SQL ` ['siːkwəl]`

  - SQL is not a proprietary language used by specific database vendors. Almost every major RDBMS supports SQL, so learning this one language enables you
to interact with just about every database you'll run into.

  - SQL is easy to learn. The statements are all made up of descriptive English words, and there aren't that many of them.
 
  - Despite its apparent simplicity, SQL is actually a very powerful language, and by cleverly using its language elements you can perform very complex and
sophisticated database operations.
