    - Dead
    
3. Implementation

    - Implement `Runnable` interface

4. Multithreading


5. Thread priority
    - `MIN_PRIORITY` 1
    - `MAX_PRIORITY` 10
    - `NORMAL_PRIORITY` 5
    
6. Synchronization
    - synchronization method
    - synchronization block
    
7. Thread safe
    - `Vector`
